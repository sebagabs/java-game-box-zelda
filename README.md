# Java Game Box: Legend of Zelda
**Worked from April 2020 to May 2020**

Third and final project for the CIIC 4010: Advanced Programming course (object oriented programming in Java).

The objective of this project was to develop Java Game Box: Legend of Zelda a simplified version of the game of the century Legend of Zelda. This project was worked in teams of two students. The project helped develop technical skills such as:

 - reading and understanding Java code
 - creating classes and methods
 - creating recursive class and methods
 - implementing these in Java

Originally, a base-unfinished code was given, with the purpose for it to be completed to meet with project specs and requirements. This project was worked by [sebastian-maldonado4](https://github.com/sebastian-maldonado4) and [alanreyes28](https://github.com/alanreyes28).
